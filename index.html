        Among his numerous scientific accomplishments, he is best known for
        his discovery of Eris, the most massive object found in the solar system in 150 years,
        and the object which led to the debate and eventual demotion of Pluto
        from a real planet to a dwarf planet.
        He is also one of the first proponents of Planet 9,
        a proposed Neptune-sized body lurking in the outer Solar System beyond Neptune.
        Mike was the principal investigator of the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey

2007 OR10's orbit places it in the Kuiper belt, the sea of icy planetesimals that orbit beyond Neptune. Over 3000 Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) are known to date. 2007 OR10 resides on an elliptical orbit. It makes it closest approach to the Sun at 33 au (1 au is the mean distance between the Earth and Sun), and its furthest point from the Sun is at a distance of 101 au. 2007 OR10 has a typical orbit of a scattered disk Kuiper belt object, one that was emplaced into the Kuiper belt during the migration of our Solar System's giant planets, including Neptune, through gravitational scattering.               </p>

              2007 OR10 was discovered July 17, 2007 as part of the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey that was searching for distant bodies in the Kuiper belt and beyond. The survey employed the  <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html"  style="display: inline"> 48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope </a> located at  <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html" style="display: inline"> Palomar Observatory </a> in Southern California. Moving Solar System bodies were discovered, by taken an image on one night and returning to take a second image ~1-2 hours later and then coming back the next night with two image pair separated by ~1-2 hours.

              We know from previously measured densities/bulk internal compositions of bodies of similar size to 2007 OR10, that the body  is likely a mixture of ice and rock. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed that there are large quantities of pure water ice and possibly traces of methane ice on 2007 OR10's surface. 2007 OR10 has one of the reddest surfaces ever found in the Kuiper belt. It is suspected that its red hue comes from the irradiation of the trace amounts of methane ice on its surface (similar to dwarf planet-sized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50000_Quaoar" style="display: inline">Quaoar). It is suspected that water ice on 2007 OR10's surface indicates past cryovolcanism earlier on in the planetesimal's history where water from the interior coated and froze on the surface.

      We don't quite know 2007 OR10's size accurately, but a good guess is that 2007 OR10 is ~ 1250 km in dimeter, a bit smaller than Pluto and Eris.  It is likely large enough for gravity to make it round, making it a candidate dwarf planet.  </p><p> Artist Rendition Credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EightTNOs.png" style="display: inline">Lexicon </a> - based on an a graphic created by: NASA, ESA, and A.

    <div class="row">

    <div class="col-sm-12">

    <h3>Why do you want to name 2007 OR10 now?</h3>
    <p>
      We know, it's been a long wait!
      We've always wanted to have some kind of public involvement in naming
      2007 OR10, but we also wanted to know more about the object
      to give it a name that fits.
      We've also been busy with research, work, and life (Meg has moved continents
      multiple times during this period).
      Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/GeertHub">Geert Barentsen</a>
      who helped create this site for us.
    </p>

    <h3>When will the results be announced?</h3>
    <p>
      Voting lasts for two weeks and then we'll announce the results
      of the most popular naming suggestion on TBD.
    </p>

    <h3>Will this be the official name?</h3>
    <p>
      Hopefully. When a planetesimal in the Solar System has a secure orbit,
      the Minor Planet Center invites suggestions from the discovers for a period up to 10 years.
      The Minor Planet Center passes the suggested name and justification
      from the discoverers to the International Astronomical Union's (IAU)
      Committee for Small-Body Nomenclature which makes the final decision.
      More details can be found <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/HowNamed.html">here</a>.

    <h3>So we're just suggesting a name to be considered?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. It is the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Committee
      for Small-Body Nomenclature which makes the final decision.
      More details can be found <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/HowNamed.html">here</a>.
      In most past cases, the name suggested by the discoverers
      as long as fits the naming guidelines has been taken as the formal name
      for the Solar System body, but the IAU Committee for Small-Body Nomenclature
      has the final say to ultimately accept or reject the naming suggestion.
      So, we think there's a good chance that the naming suggestion with the most votes
      will become the official name for 2007 OR10.
      If the top choice is not accepted, we will submit the second most popular
      choice to the IAU for consideration.
    </p>   

    <h3>How did you pick these names?</h3>
    <p>
      We tried to select deities where their origin stories had the color red connected to it and also where there was a theme of inside turning outside to connect to the suspected past cryovolcanism on 2007 OR10.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Can I see 2007 OR10 in the night sky by eye?</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, no. We can see about visual magnitude ~8 stars by eye in very dark skies, and the brightness of of 2007 OR10 is about 21st-22nd magnitude.
    </p>   
      
    <h3>When was 2007 OR10 discovered?</h3>
    <p>
      July 17, 2007, UT in the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey.
      Pre-recovery observations find observations for the object
      as early as 1985 that have been reported to the Minor Planet Center.
    </p>

    <h3>What does 2007 OR10 stand for?</h3>
    <p>
      That's the designation that the Minor Planet Center,
      which keeps track of discoveries in our Solar System
      gave for this Kuiper belt object.
      You can think of it like the license plate numbers for motor vehicles.
      All minor planets including Pluto and Eris have an identifier like this.
    </p>

    <h3>What's the Minor Planet Center?</h3>
    <p>
      The Minor Planet Center is responsible for keeping track
      of all the discoveries and orbits for minor bodies in the Solar System.
      You can learn more about their mission at

    <h3>How did you come up with the proposed names?</h3>
    <p>
      Objects in the Kuiper belt in similar orbits to 2007 OR10
      must be given names associated with mythological figures
      associated with creation.
      More details on the suggested naming requirements put forth
      by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) can be found 
      <a href="http://www.ss.astro.umd.edu/IAU/csbn/mpnames.shtml">here</a> and <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/"> here</a>.
      We tried to find mythologies from across the world
      that fit the IAU naming criteria and whose origin and characteristics
      related in some way to the properties we know of for 2007 OR10.

    <h3>I've got a cool name to suggest. Who should I get in touch with?</h3>
    <p>
      That's great, but we're going to pick the naming suggestion
      with the most votes from our list of three.
    </p>
